            <h2>Talk to a Career Coach</h2>
            <p>The Career Development Office (CDO) has a team of career coaches who work with students 1:1 to directly support students in achieving their career-related goals. This looks different from student to student and session to session. We use a coaching model centered around what the student individually needs at the moment.</p>
            <p>Coaching sessions might be questions-oriented, a review of best practices and resources, a review of documents’ content, reflection on well-being in the job search, and practice.</p>
            <p>The CDO also hires and trains a team of Peer Career Coaches to meet with BSI and master's students at UMSI. This is a valuable opportunity to receive peer coaching from students who have successfully gone through the internship/job search process. These students have applied their UMSI knowledge to diverse roles and industries.</p>
            <p>Options for coaching appointments and preparing for a coaching session are below</p>
